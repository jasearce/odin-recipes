# The Odin Project: Foundations Course
## Project: Recipes

### Introduction
This is the first project from the foundations course of The Odin Project platform. In this project, we will be applying HTML basic skills acquired through the curriculum.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won’t look very pretty by the time you’ve finished but it’s important to keep in mind that this project is just to build your HTML chops; we will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.
